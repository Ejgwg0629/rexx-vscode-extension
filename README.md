# rexx README

This is the README for rexx-vscode-extension.

## Features

- syntax highlighting for rexx
- do simple symbols parsing

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Actually, I've just copied [websi96](https://github.com/websi96)'s extension and made some modifications,
it can hardly be said to be my extension..

But I'm going to add some other features as long as I'm still working here
using rexx.
