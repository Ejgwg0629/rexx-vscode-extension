# z/OS-TSO-REXX

This is a syntax highlighter for z/OS TSO/E REXX.

Syntax is based on [IBM's REXX syntax here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.ikja300/intro.htm).

## Features

- syntax highlighting for rexx
- do simple symbols parsing

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Actually, I've just copied [websi96](https://github.com/websi96)'s extension and made some modifications,
it can hardly be said to be my extension..

But I'm going to add some other features as long as I'm still working here
using rexx.
